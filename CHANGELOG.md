# Changelog

## Changed in v2025.6

* Updated for 11.1.5 and 1.15.7
* The dark magic scanning method is now disabled as Blizzard has closed the loophole it relied on with a change to 11.1.5. If you're looking for non-vignette mobs, I recommend falling back on using the macro.

## Changed in v2025.5

* Undermine: added new loot for rares, consolidated the Steamboil / Handcrank parts
* RangeExtender:
    * Don't interfere with the tooltip for the native vignette when it *is* visible
    * Show a tag in the tooltip so the source is more obvious
    * Change the framelevels so they'll be a bit higher based on the Minimap frame

## Changed in v2025.4

* Undermine: update rare coordinates, add loot to the treasure vignettes
* Bump the TOC for the SilverDragon_History plugin specifically (thanks Adal!)

## Changed in v2025.3

* Updated for 11.1.0
* Rares for Undermine
* Transform all Ringing Deeps coords because 11.1.0 shrunk it horizontally

## Changed in v2025.2

* Siren Isle: update the storm phase mobs

## Changed in v2025.1

* Siren Isle: quest updates, add the Proper Parrot to pirate rares
* Don't get the wrong coordinates for mobs when the vignette is in the parent zone and doesn't have location data in the child zone (see: the Forbidden Vault)
* General better display of unknown coordinates
* Make macro updates less spammy (only edit the macro if it has actually changed)

## Changed in v2024.34

* Siren Isle updates for the pirate phase
* Proper data update for Cataclysm Classic

## Changed in v2024.33

* More Siren Isle data
* Fixed the locations for a few enemies in Dun Morogh
* Port the right-click menus on map icons to the new menu system
* Sneakily disable the AddOnSkins integration with SilverDragon if it's installed, since it's been completely broken and my single biggest source of bug reports for several years now

## Changed in v2024.32

* Updated for 11.0.7 / 1.15.5
* Partial data for Siren Isle

## Changed in v2024.31

* Add vignettes and achievement status for The Originals
* Avoid a potential error when checking achievement status for some unusual criteria

## Changed in v2024.30

* Add new world bosses in the 20th anniversary celebration

## Changed in v2024.29

* Added a bunch of Vanilla rares and loot that were re-added back in 10.1.7
* Fix an issue in classic / cataclysm when showing popups for mobs with loot

## Changed in v2024.28

* Made dark magic scanning a little more efficient

## Changed in v2024.26

* Added quests for this week's world boss Orta
* Ignore Xal'atath in mythics, even though she's flagged as a rare

## Changed in v2024.25

* Fix particularly short minimap route segments not being displayed
* Fix for occasional mobs with *very specific* arrangements of loot not showing a loot icon in the LDB popup
* Minor data improvements in Suramar

## Changed in v2024.24

* Added quests for this week's world boss Shurrai
* Fixed the display of the quest for Deathtide

## Changed in v2024.23

* War Within data updates: added a few missing weekly reputation quests, filled out the loot in Treasures vignettes for Hallowfall and Azj-Kahet

## Changed in v2024.22

* Don't update the macro if the Blizzard macro frame is visible -- it resets edits you're making to macros.

## Changed in v2024.21

* Include season 1 world bosses
* Macros are rewritten for the 11.0 limitations (finally); now tries to target as many of the mobs close to you as will fit in 255 character, now can include (zone-specific) custom mobs, and has an option to target with `/tar` rather than `/targetexact` to save space
* Option in target-scanning to completely skip dead rares (this is more extreme than the existing option to not announce them, because it'll stop them from being added to the last-seen)
* Fix an issue in classic when showing loot windows on popups

## Changed in v2024.20

* Absolutely massive behind-the-scenes change to how I track loot, which you will hopefully notice nothing about apart from it allowing me to...
* Add weekly reputation quests and reputation rewards to War Within rares
* Show how long the shadow phase has left on the Spawn of Beledar
* Announcements: fix missing label for the Effects channel, add a test button that'll play the sound actually on the channel you selected so you can tell how loud it'll be
* Overlay: fix showing requirement colors inverted in overlay tooltips
* It's been 8 years: remove the database migration code from SilverDragon 2

## Changed in v2024.19

* History: fixed the frame not hiding immediately at the start of combat
* Fixed some issues with profile-switching in History and ClickTargets
* Stop showing the marker on the popup for a rare if you mark a different rare

## Changed in v2024.18

* New loot for all War Within zones
* Add The Missing Lynx achievement for tooltips
* Add To All the Slimes I Love achievement for tooltips
* Add Echoes of Danger achievement for tooltips
* Overlay: route pins should also sabotage SetPassThroughButtons; this should stop occasional action-blocked errors

## Changed in v2024.17

* New loot for all War Within zones
* Don't put tomtom waypoints on the world map, stick to the crazy arrow
* Improve the tooltips for history and popups
* Add data to show in treasure-popups in Isle of Dorn and Ringing Deeps

## Changed in v2024.16

* A bunch of new loot for Hallowfall
* Fix TomTom waypoints still pushing onto the arrow (with a more specific combination of settings between addons required now!), and not clearing after the popup closed

## Changed in v2024.15

* A bunch of new loot for the Ringing Deeps
* Fix ctrl-clicking to set a waypoint from popups/history/etc not forcing its way into TomTom's crazy arrow

## Changed in v2024.14

* A bunch of new loot for the Isle of Dorn
* Waypoints can now be set for loot as well
* Support for Map Pin Enhanced for waypoints

## Changed in v2024.13

* Data for the War Within (from the beta: a few mobs aren't found yet, and there's a lot of loot missing)
* Custom mobs can now set per-zone
* Per-zone custom mobs will be picked up by the dark magic scanning method
* Fix relative time display in history window for over 30 minutes ago
* Fix an obscure error with double-releasing popups on leaving combat

## Changed in v2024.12

* History: keep the frame position stable when toggling collapsed state
* Merged some contributions from Tom: OOX-Fleetfoot/MG, Vixx the Collector, and fixing announcements for Ravenomous and Sister Chelicerae in Seat of the Primus
* Fix a deprecated API call in 11.0.2

## Changed in v2024.11

* Add some tracking of the server shard you've seen a mob in
    * Currently only expresses itself as an option to show/dim/hide mobs from other shards in the history frame
    * In the future this will probably make its way into the announcement options so e.g. notifications from guild members will be more relevant
* Allow resizing of the history frame
* Allow right-clicking on an item in the history frame to remove just it
* DarkMagic: avoid an error that could happen if you chose to suppress other errors (meta!)
* Prep for some API deprecations in 11.0.2

## Changed in v2024.10.1

* Option to show relative times in the history window, on by default

## Changed in v2024.10

* Clicking the line in the history window will now try to target the mob (so long as you're out-of-combat)
* The history window wouldn't fully disable itself until your UI reloaded (it would reappear when you saw a rare)
* Added some fallbacks for missing textures in Classic
* Fix a very-rare error with missing achievement names in popups

## Changed in v2024.9

* New submodule: History
    * Shows a window with a log of rares you've seen, and when you saw them
    * Should make it easier to work out how long it has been since a rare spawned
* New scanning method: "dark magic"
    * Abuses detection of when Blizzard blocks attempts to call a protected function (TargetUnit) to work out when you're in targetting range of a unit with a given name
    * This *inherently* causes in-game errors, so it is disabled by default
    * Enable in the addon config under "Scanning > Dark Magic"
    * By default it's less-aggressive, scanning through rares in the zone without known vignettes at a rate of 1/second. However, you can turn that rate way up if you'd like.
    * You can also turn on an option to automatically hide the error messages it causes, but beware that this will probably cause taint issues that'll leave you needing to `/reload` eventually
* New option for popups so you can disable 3d models
    * Addresses a prepatch issues where some people are reporting crashes when certain models are displayed (through the Blizzard dialog popups as well, so this isn't a complete fix)
    * In most looks will just show a generic texture, but Minimal will aggressively shrink down
* Waypoints: fix that creating a TomTom waypoint wasn't respecting the replacement setting (so it was always overriding your existing waypoint)
* Show in the addon compartment

## Changed in v2024.8

* Show more information about items in tooltips (item type, cosmetic)
* Add Aurastor to Emerald Dream
* BfA assaults: add Shek'zara and Vuk'laz loot, fix multi-assault rares that weren't showing

## Changed in v2024.6

* Updated for 11.0.0
* Include Ordos' loot in the Mists module

## Changed in v2024.5

* Vignette scanning: option to alert on zone-wide vignettes. I originally disabled these because it can be really spammy in zones like Timeless Isles / Zereth Mortis. Turn it off in the options at `Scanning > Vignettes`
* Add the I'm In Your Base, Killing Your Dudes achievement in Krasarang
* Remove a long-removed-from-the-game old trinket from Kal'tik the Blight

## Changed in v2024.4

* TOC for 10.2.7
* Mists data improvements: some missing questids, mob positions in the Vale, and some better accounting for phasing in Krasarang
* Minor data tweaks in Dragonflight
* Fixed the alert for the Armored Vaultbot in Mechagon

## Changed in v2024.3.1

* Updated ChatThrottleLib, which had some bugged behavior when upgrading older versions causing lots of errors

## Changed in v2024.3

* Updated TOC for 10.2.6 (oops, thanks to Xarano)
* Updated coordinates for the Mysterious Camel Figuring (thanks to Xarano)

## Changed in v2024.2

* Updated to not error in Cataclysm Classic (data adjustments to follow)
* Taxi setting will now also suppress alerts while you're in a dragon race

## Changed in v2024.1.1

* Missed some of the separated-addon TOCs

## Changed in v2024.1

* Updated for 10.2.5
* Noted the pet for the 7.3.5 Silithid rares in Silithus

## Changed in v2023.11

* Show data on world quest icons if available
* Ohn'ahran Plains: locations for a few remaining Adventurer rares
* Arathi Highlands: add Doom's Howl, and a few world quest IDs

## Changed in v2023.10.1

* Blizzard hotfixed out the range-check API that I was using to only announce rares that nearby group members saw, so I've switched to a different API for that.

## Changed in v2023.10

* Fix for an issue that was preventing icons appearing on the world map in Classic for some people
* Some minor data fixes for past expansions

## Changed in v2023.9

* More loot and ids for Emerald Dream rares
* Fix Primal Scythid Queen's location in Waking Shores
* Remove a stray Lost Gilnean Wardog from Thunder Bluff

## Changed in v2023.8

* Updated for 10.2.0
* New rares for the Emerald Dream, still missing a few quest IDs so expect another update soon
* Update some rares from the last few patches, and include various assault rares as hidden-mobs

## Changed in v2023.7

* Updated for 10.1.5 and then 10.1.7
* Fixed error in classic_era (Vanilla)
* Fixed some errors causing permission errors in combat (10.1.5 protected SetPassThroughButtons)

## Changed in v2023.6.1

* Removed Skornak's Lava Ball, which never made it to live servers

## Changed in v2023.6

* More Zaralek Cavern data
* Suppress alerts while a cinematic is running

## Changed in v2023.5

* More Zaralek Cavern data
* Hide the mystery vignette in Loamm

## Changed in v2023.4

* New Zaralek Cavern rares for 10.1.0
* Forbidden Reach's Forbidden Hoard now has loot

## Changed in v2023.3

* New Forbidden Reach rares for 10.0.7
* Make the Stormed Off rares from Primal Storms work properly for alerts
* Was missing Overseer Stonetongue
* Assorted minor data fixes

## Changed in v2023.2

* New rares for 10.0.5
* Fix Emerald Garden Explorer's Notes / Ruby Gem Cluster Map mixup in some treasure tooltips

## Changed in v2023.1

* Quest ID for Liskanoth
* Fix an error that was occuring in zones with time-gated events on days with no calendar events active

## Changed in v2022.33

* More mining of mobs and loot
* Tooltips: option not to show loot while in combat, because MysticalOS complained about it taking up too much space when using mouseover macros
* Custom / ignore options: remember rares seen this session so you can just go into settings and ignore them by checking a box, without needing to look up their ID
* Range extender: hide some of the more inconvenient "mystery" vignettes that're just highlights for NPCs in towns. I have to manually flag these, so I'll improve these over time.
* Added all the treasure-maps to the dragonscale expedition treasures
* Avoid an error that could happen in some weird cases for the popup
* Fix a few rares showing in the wrong map phase in Battle for Azeroth zones

## Changed in v2022.32

* Major mining of mobs and loot
* Fix the addon being stuck in debug mode for everyone because of a bad check (say goodbye to "ID" and "location" on all the map tooltips)
* Since we were stuck in debug mode for everyone, everyone has been getting experiemental mob-name code for the last few releases... so properly release that and clean up. This noticably reduces SavedVariables size and memory usage.

## Changed in v2022.31

* Differentiate treasure vignettes on GUID rather than ID -- this is going to make things like the Expedition Scout's Pack or Disturbed Dirt pop up alerts more frequently, since every separate copy of them is going to alert
* A bunch of data improvements
* Don't double-up on the LDB mob-tooltip

## Changed in v2022.30

* Questids and some added loot for all the ["super rares"](https://www.wowhead.com/news/defeat-super-rares-each-day-for-up-to-385-item-level-gear-330298), thanks to Znuff
* Show Sleeping on the Job and Who's a Good Bakar in mob tooltips
* Show requirements for active mobs in map tooltips, too

## Changed in v2022.29

* Update Dragonflight rares
* Add Who's A Good Bakar? to tooltips
* Improve how the popup's loot button count behaves when only showing items relevant to your character; it'll now notice when item data isn't loaded from the server completely and refresh the count once it's available
* Fix display of the Battle For Azeroth Black Empire Assault rares, which I had tied to the continent-level icons that Blizzard removed when Dragonflight launched

## Changed in v2022.28

* Changed the behavior of the loot button on the popup a bit: it'll now always show if there's any loot, but loot not suitable for your character will be grayed out
* Add the Expedition Scout's Pack loot-data for vignettes
* Fixed an error that would pop up on logging in for people playing Wrath

## Changed in v2022.27

* Dragonflight data added. It's incomplete (some achievement-rares were never even seen in the beta period), so expect a bunch of releases over the next month or two.
* Improve the model position/background in a few of the non-default popup skins
* Workaround for the 10.0 model-interior-alpha bug in the popup models (the model still being visible until combat ended if a popup auto-hid in combat)

## Changed in v2022.26

* Classic: route lines were sometimes being hidden behind explored territory on maps

## Changed in v2022.25

* Major data improvements to Burning Crusade rares (because I also released [HandyNotes: Burning Crusade](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/handynotes-burning-crusade)...)
* Another fix for macro generation with 10.0.2's new /click requirements
* Fix for mob tooltips being prevented from fading away in Classic
* Minor data fixes for Warlords, including finally showing Warleader Tome's route

## Changed in v2022.24

* Updated for 10.0.2
* Generate the macro based on the current ActionButtonUseKeyDown cvar
* Include the Anniversary mobs and their loot, which should only show up during the anniversary event

## Changed in v2022.23

* The popup can now know about loot in treasures, including whether to give the popup the mount-alert treatment
    * It only knows about the loot in a few Zereth Mortis treasures currently; I'm not sure how much I'm going to backfill this
* Right-clicking the pins on the world map will work again (10.0.0 broke this)
* Fix several ways that SilverDragon (+ the new 10.0.0 frame layout system) could cause taint that would eventually block some actions
* Minor work towards 10.0.2 compatibility
* Zereth Mortis: show all Gorkek's spawn points

## Changed in v2022.22

* Macro fixes:
    * In Wrath the lines with `/print` were apparently causing issues
    * In Retail, `/click` now absolutely requires that you specify the fake mouse button you want to use rather than assuming left-click
    * As such, I've added some automatic regeneration of the macro so it can be updated to the new version without you needing to manually touch it
    * Turns out macros on secure action buttons can be much longer than real macros, so I've reduced the number of fake passthrough macro buttons I create

## Changed in v2022.21

* Updated for 10.0.0 (but no data for Dragonflight rares is included yet)
* Merged my classic and retail versions together... changing my version-number scheme because I can't base it off the TOC any more
* Separate data-addons are no longer being used; you should delete them if your addon manager doesn't clean them up for you
* Missing Wrath loot was added, and routes added to many Wrath rares
* Various Pandaria locations were improved
* A few bugs around waypoint-setting were fixed
* Loot popups will no longer show a hint implying they can be clicked to target anything

## Changed in v90207.0

* Updated for 9.2.7
* Avoid error when trying to find distance to a mob with no route to you

## Changed in v90205.2

* New option to only consider transmogs obtained if you have that exact item (disabled by default)
* Some cosmetic items were incorrectly saying they wouldn't drop for anyone, mostly Korthia back items it seemed

## Changed in v90205.1

* New option to only show loot the current character can receive. Find it in `Settings > General > Loot`, off by default while I make sure it doesn't have any problems.
* Better data in Pandaria; mostly fixing up the spam on the Timeless Isle and the Zandalari Warbringers
* Better fix for the C_TransmogCollection API changes

## Changed in v90205.0

* Updated for 9.2.5, fixing errors about C_TransmogCollection (in a rush, so there might be followup fixes)
* Make scrolling inside long mob list tooltips much faster
* Added missing vignette ID for the Sinstone Hoarder in Revendreth

## Changed in v90200.11

* New announcement type: controller vibration, if you've enabled a controller via `/console GamePadEnable 1`
* Option in Outputs for whether to treat known-mounts as uninteresting; you might want to uncheck this if you're e.g. helping someone else hunt for a specific mount that you've already obtained
* Tweaks to what counts as "partially complete" for icons on the map, so non-achievement mobs with loot will be better represented
* When sending messages to chat, include a map pin hyperlink if available
* Add a missing mountid in Korthia
* Some earlier-expansion loot in Cataclysm, Pandaria, and Battle for Azeroth

## Changed in v90200.10.1

* Fixed an error that would happen on maps with mobs that have routes associated

## Changed in v90200.10

* Avoid some issues with switching profiles in settings
* Fix the open achievement item in the right-click menu
* Zereth Mortis: include the Dune Dominance mobs vignette IDs for better alerts
* Mechagon: stop the chat-alerts from saying the Arachnoid Harvester is the time-displaced version

## Changed in v90200.9

* If you checked for transmogs being known very soon after the game loaded, some bad information could be cached because item information wasn't fully loaded from the server yet. This would make SilverDragon report that some items weren't learnable until your next UI reload. This should no longer happen.
* Minor tweak to Blistermaw's location in Antoran Wastes

## Changed in v90200.8

* Map pins will only show a mob with the mount icon if you're eligible for that mount (unless it's one of the BoE mounts, which are always given priority)
* Similarly, announcement sounds and screen flashes will only use their mount variants for mounts you don't have yet or BoE mounts
* Right-click menu on map pins give you a shortcut to open the achievement associated with that mob
* A zonewide point-of-interest means the same thing as vignette: you're definitely eligible to loot that mob
* Zereth Mortis: assorted improvements to treasure/rare requirements
* Maw tweaks:
    * Tea for the Troubled mobs will show as "completed" rather than "killed" in tooltips
    * Minions of the Cold Dark is tracked in tooltips
* Legion: added some missing loot and cleaned up some data (legendaries had snuck in where they shouldn't...)

## Changed in v90200.7.1

* Fixed a typo in the Architect's Reserve treasure requirements that was causing an error when it was up

## Changed in v90200.7

* Dune Dominance mobs: more loot
* Helmix: only announce one bit of it
* Hide various other treasures in ZM until they're attainable (Rogues, Warlocks, and Venthyr not accounted for.)

## Changed in v90200.6

* Improvements to mob positions when linking to chat and making waypoints:
    * If we see a vignette after some other method, update the popup to know about that
    * If we know about a vignette, always request fresh coordinates from it rather than trusting the initial coords
    * Don't trust that the player must be nearby if we noticed the mob from an emote, thanks lots of Zereth Mortis zone-wide emotes
* March 3rd hotfix: Interrogator's Vicious Dirk now drops from all the Dune Domination mobs
* Orixal has moved

## Changed in v90200.5

* More loot added in from wowhead
* Have announcing the Provis Cache wait for you having the key rather than just having the prereq quest completed
* Properly show the Completing the Code status on all the relevant mobs

## Changed in v90200.4

* Added a bunch of loot from wowhead
* Only play the special mount announcement sounds for rares with mounts you're eligible to loot

## Changed in v90200.3

* Don't error when announcing a completely-unknown rare

## Changed in v90200.2

* Gave myself the ability to much better flag mobs and treasures as having conditions that must be met before they'll be alerted
* ...used this for some Zereth Mortis treasures. I still need to gather more vignette IDs for this, but the worst offenders should be gone.
* Coincidentally, show the vignette ID if known on the tooltip for the mob/loot popup
* Korthia: Xyraxz the Unknowable seems to not drop Gnashtooth after all

## Changed in v90200.1

* ...also, update the TOC version.

## Changed in v90200.0

* Data added for Zereth Mortis
* If you manually-add a mob it'll still be announced if it's seen controlled by another player
* Don't double add some mob's data to the tooltip for Blizzard's zone map POI announcements

## Changed in v90105.2

* Add a new Maelie location
* Fixed an issue for some people causing errors when viewing maps with routes

## Changed in v90105.1

* Fix an error that could happen if you have minimap rotation turned on in rare situations

## Changed in v90105.0

* Updated for 9.1.5: mostly this just means LibQTip was updated
* Stopped Korthia from having the Maw's short-range vignette detection rules applied
* Avoid an error about `facing` that could happen if the map was open before the player was fully in the world
* Add various covenant assault achievements to tooltips

## Changed in v90100.8

* Improve sending locations to chat:
    * If there's a vignette available it'll be used for the most-reliable location, and vignettes being seen *after* a chat announcement will update the target popup
    * Show the associated location in the tooltip for the target popup
* Improve the minimap:
    * Show mob routes (if present) on the minimap
    * Fix minimap icon alpha settings not being applied
    * Make minimap icon motion smoother
* Burning Crusade: add a few mob patrol routes
* Vignette range extender: let clicks pass through the icons onto the minimap
* Ardenweald: Show the Ardenweald's a Stage achievement in tooltips
* Add a few sounds to the default set I register with LibSharedMedia
* If loot is restricted (covenant, class), still show it as known if you've got it

## Changed in v90100.7

* The vignette range extender has a new option to show "mystery" vignettes that exist but are hidden from the API. I can't tell *what* any specific one is, but they tend to be lootable things like relic caches in Korthia.
* Observer Yorik has a new questid, and so won't keep on looking incomplete
* Reliwik has an associated vignetteid that'll help with alerts
* Mobs that had a mount/pet *and* toys *and* regular items as loot had a tooltip glitch with overlapping loot tooltips

## Changed in v90100.6

* Changed some anti-loot-spam code that had gone overzealous and was stopping you seeing the off-minimap rares in Korthia

## Changed in v90100.5

* Maw:
    * Added Traitor Balthier, Demen the Vortex, Guard Orguluus
    * Skittering Broodmother has moved
* Korthia:
    * A few new Maelie locations
    * Show Zelnithop inside Gromit Hollow
    * Recognize the Stygian Stonecrusher vignette and Drippy's yell
* Revendreth: more loot on the inquisitors
* Rewrote some tracking quest handling so that Maelie will now stay counted as complete once you've completed the final day
* Removed the Glimmerfly Cocoon, since it seems to definitely not be dropping

## Changed in v90100.4

* Mine new loot; lots added to the Maw rares

## Changed in v90100.3

* Missing Maw rares: Blinding Shadow, Fallen Charger
* Include the Playful Vulpin in Ardenweald. It's a critter, so nameplate scanning can't catch it, but the macro will work.
* Show a note in the map-icon tooltip if the Overlay addon is disabled, so you know why there are no icons
* Show achievement status for all of Consumption's stages
* Add some loot

## Changed in v90100.2

* Add rare information to the Blizzard world map icons (the big stars in Korthia, mostly)
* Explain Consumption, because people are killing it too soon 😭
* Don't try to set target icons in raids unless you're the RL
* Add some missing 9.1 Maw rares
* Add vignetteids to trigger alerts for Korthia rares whose names aren't their event

## Changed in v90100.1

* Conquering Korthia achievement
* Maelie the Wanderer in Korthia
* Better display of long notes in tooltips

## Changed in v90100.0

* Update for 9.1
* New rares in Korthia
* Avoid an error in loot when an item is uncached and not fetched

## Changed in v90005.2

* Blizzard has fixed a few typos in mob names, so add some code that'll refresh the name-cache when you actually see one of these mobs
* Range extended minimap vignettes weren't showing tooltips
* Check parent zones for mobs with a given name, which should help when you hear a yell while in a subzone
* Fixed right-clicking the popup close button to ignore the mob
* Miscellaneous small data cleanups

## Changed in v90005.1

* Updated with new loot from wowhead
* Fixed chat scanning

## Changed in v90005.0

* Avoid a new issue which caused errors when showing/hiding the popup in 9.0.5 (had to remove some normal API calls here, so there might be subtle issues with the mouse working on a hidden-in-combat popup until this is resolved on Blizzard's end)
* Popups have been rewritten!
    * They're now a stack, rather than a new one immediately replacing the current popup. (If you prefer the old behavior, you can set the stack size to 1 in the options and it'll be about the same.)
    * They should overlap less windows now.
* Don't play multiple sounds at once. This was particularly bad for rares like the Beasts of Bastion, which simultaneously played the announcement four times, making it way too loud.
* Trim the final awwwk off of Ikiss' loot announcement
* Make help tooltips more compact in general
* Add mobs that trigger via the yell for Sire Ladinas
* Ability to toggle the map overlay per-zone by shift-clicking on the broker icon on the world map
* Add various missing questids and improve loot

## Changed in v90002.15.1

* The broker tooltip "regular loot" icon will now show a checkmark if you have all the quests/appearances your character can get from that loot
* Fix some mounts incorrectly showing as collected
* Fix Tomb Burster questid

## Changed in v90002.15

* Transmog appearances can now be counted as part of mob completion. I've disabled this by default for now, but it's in "settings > outputs > ...include transmog appearances" as a modifier to the existing "got the loot" setting.
* More updates to loot data
* Add It's Always Sinny In Revendreth to tracked achievements
* Fix a number of mobs appearing in Durotar that shouldn't have
* Fix restricted items (covenant/class-specific) counting towards loot completion if you couldn't get them
* Fix restriction labels on the popup tooltip going outside the tooltip borders

## Changed in v90002.14

* A huge amount of loot has been added, across all expansions. I've only added unique-to-that-mob loot
* Now support loot that has an associated quest, and count it for completion purposes. I'm looking at you, Mechagon blueprints
* Update tameable-mob information, which was very out of date, and show the icon for the type of tameable mob in the broker tooltip
* Fix item-type headers not showing in the loot summary part of tooltips

## Changed in v90002.13

* Loot can now be flagged as being covenant/class-specific, and some is; Blizzard is quiet about what counts, so we're going by wowhead comments here, expect further updates
* Checkmark on the popup loot icon was missing if you had all the knowable loot
* Stop an error when mousing over the loot icon on the popup for mobs with more than 3 items that'd have to be previewed
* Sharing a link to chat could fail if you were in an area where the general channel couldn't be identified; it'll fall back properly to opening the chatbox now
* Stop the map overlay from pinging multiple mobs at once if a vignette was visible when you first logged in
* Apparently I missed migrating Cataclysm loot data to the new format a few releases back, so it wasn't properly showing mounts and pets

## Changed in v90002.12

* Better vignette scanning options:
    * You can ignore specific vignettes, including loot vignette (see options > scanning > vignettes > ignore)
    * You can ignore entire categories of vignette by their icon (in particular, the white-skull for Maw bonus bosses may be of interest here...)
* Fix Dead Blanchy's position
* Add Fractured Faerie Tales achievement completion to tooltips

## Changed in v90002.11

* Don't try to draw routes if the map isn't visible (this caused some `y2 is nil` errors, if you saw those)
* Add some more vignette ids to the Maw

## Changed in v90002.10

* Changed the way I was picking distinct colors for map icons
* Fixed an issue where some people were having the minimap icons disabled when logging in
* Fixed an issue where two mobs with identical coordinates wouldn't show up on the map
* Add a few mob routes in Bastion

## Changed in v90002.9

* Can now show mob routes on the map. But I've not added much yet. So, if you want to see it, the Time Lost Proto-Drake is it for this release.
* Avoid an error in the vignette scanner during certain zone transitions
* There's now a crack-of-thunder sound included as an announcement option

## Changed in v90002.8.1

* Reverted the no-target-hunter-pet thing because it didn't work

## Changed in v90002.8

* Scanning macro improvements:
    * Will no longer target hunter pets with the same name as a rare
    * Zones with lots of rares will no longer be quietly truncated by the macro length limit, all rares will now be scanned
* Improved chat scanning so we can catch the Sire Ladinas yell which comes from a different mob
* Improved the detection of zones where we should restrict the range at which we scan for vignettes (no more going into caves in Ardenweald and having Ikiss yell at you suddenly)
* Restrict all scanning in the Maw to visible-only, because of the rare-density there
* Automatically shift the points in the map overlay so they try not to overlap each other
* Range-extended vignettes now have smaller icons but easier mouseover tooltip targets
* Broker tooltip anchor is adjusted to avoid overlapping the map
* Include the Wild Hunting achievement
* Various data updates in Shadowlands

## Changed in v90002.7

* In the mobs options, expose achievements so you can easily ignore/unignore every mob for a given achievement. Like, hypothetically, if you want to stop being notified about the Maw bonus bosses, you can quickly hide everything for "It’s About Sending a Message"
* Split up the options for the map overlay: you can now control everything separately about minimap and worldmap pins
* Changed the defaults for minimap pins so that their tooltips are less bulky
* Added a central toggle for scanning for loot vignettes in the scan>vignette options, so you don't have to turn announcements off in several places if you don't want them.
* Forbidding certain vignettes from being announced. I'm looking at you, Garrison Cache
* Fixed the location of the Ascended Council in Bastion (thanks rainfordays!)
* Filled out other mob locations / vignette ids
* Updated some Maw loot

## Changed in v90002.6

* Click-to-ignore on the target popup didn't understand loot

## Changed in v90002.5

* Show alerts and popups when treasure vignettes appear on the map
    * Haven't y'all missed Ikiss screaming about trinkets? Well, if you really haven't, there's sound options for this.
* New option to only have vignettes trigger alerts when they actually become visible
    * This is force-enabled in Ardenweald, because it has all vignettes viewable from the entire map for some reason
* Change the behavior of the sound preferences: you can now separately toggle regular-mob sounds, mount-dropping sounds, boss sounds, and loot sounds without having to use the hack of setting the sound file to "None"
* The overlay map pins were too sensitive, triggering the tooltip sooner than was ideal
* Avoid tooltips for mobs with loot in the map overlay sticking around when they shouldn't
* Avoid the tooltip on the loot window attached to the target popup overlapping the popup poorly
* Avoid an error if you focus a mob that's in a zone with no route to you
* Touch up some Warlords data

## Changed in v90002.4

* New minimal target popup look
* Show unknowable loot attached to tooltips on the world map
* Option to not set waypoints while you're dead (because it interferes with your corpse waypoint...)
* Fix clicking the world map broker button to toggle map icons
* Various loot data updates in Shadowlands

## Changed in v90002.3

* Include unknowable loot in tooltips
    * Some of this is technically "knowable" in the transmog sense, but tracking that is complicated.
    * You can go install [AppearanceTooltip](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/appearancetooltip/) which'll integrate with the SilverDragon loot popups and show transmog-known.
* Prime the loot cache when showing the world map or broker tooltip, so you see less "loading..." for items
* Update a bunch of Shadowlands loot from new information
* Unstable Memory in Bastion had a typo in its loot
* Some fairly large behind the scenes changes to how the target popup is positioned, but what you should notice is:
    * You can now scale the target popup in settings
    * You can show an anchor for the target popup to see where it'll appear
    * The popup position is saved per-profile rather than per character

## Changed in v90002.2

* Add the ability to toggle the map icons on/off by clicking the world map broker icon
* Add a bunch of missing Shadowlands rares
* Add achievements:
    * Better to Be Lucky Than Dead (Maw)
    * It's About Sending A Message (Maw)
    * In The Mix (Maldraxxus)
    * Bloodsport (Maldraxxus)
* Vignette range extension is broken out into a sub-addon; it now has a better explanation of what's going on in the options, and lets you choose which types of vignette to range-extend
* Lots of work on rewriting the loot system
    * Some loot that's not mounts/toys/pets being visible
    * Not much is added yet; I've got most known Shadowlands drops, and I fleshed out Mechagon for blueprints and Timeless Isle drops for now
    * There's a new item in the broker tooltip to show if a rare has other known loot; click it to see a popup of that loot
* When show the text alert for a rare, if we don't know its location (e.g. zone-wide mob yells) say that rather than just showing "0,0" for it
* The chat scanning will now only announce rares that are known to exist in the current zone, and mobs you've added as custom mobs regardless of zone
    * Death Rising caused a lot of false-positives for people running the old Icecrown instances...
* In the broker tooltip, save space by showing tameable mobs with a hunter icon rather than text

## Changed in v90002.1

* Make sure the ping animation is stopped when the pin frames are reused
* Remove the Death Rising rares, since the event is done
* Fix up various Bastion mobs, including making sure they're flagged as being part of the achievement
* A few past-expansion fixes: some missing positions and a toy in Pandaria, overlapping locations in Hyjal

## Changed in v90002.0

* This one is just a TOC bump, y'all

## Changed in v90001.7

* There's a ping highlight on the world map for:
    * the last seen mob when you open the map (within 30 seconds of seeing it)
    * a focused mob right when you focus it
* Mobs on the map overlay can be shift-right-clicked to immediately hide them
* Options for whether to show mobs on the edge of the minimap; by default, only focused ones are shown there
* Mobs on the map which are completed but shown anyway get slightly smaller icons (the "stars" theme did this already, but now it's consistent)
* The "ignore mobs that an alt has completed the achievement for" option was being ignored for mobs that had a vignette
* Some mobs (Basten) couldn't be hidden from the map... but now they can!
* Chat and vignette scanning now respect the "don't scan in instances" setting

## Changed in v90001.6

* Mobs in the broker tooltip now get click actions and informational tooltips
    * Click a line to open the map with that mob focused
    * Control-click a line to set a waypoint for the closest location for that mob
    * Shift-click a line to link the closest location for that mob in chat
    * Mousing over them triggers the highlights on the map, if it's open
* Minimap pins update their focus state immediately
* Fix a spawn location for Krik'thir the Gatewatcher

## Changed in v90001.5

* Refined waypoint options:
    * Blizzard waypoints are now equivalent to TomTom/DBM, not just a fallback, and you can choose all/none of them independently
    * Blizzard waypoints weren't being auto-removed on timeout correctly
    * An error could happen on auto-removal if you had TomTom *and* DBM enabled simultaneously
* Map overlay improvements:
    * Hover over a mob to show a highlight over all locations for that mob on the map
    * Click a pin (or the mob's name in the broker dropdown) to focus it so it always shows a highlight... now you can easily find a mob after seeing its name in the broker dropdown!
    * Shift-click a pin to link to it in chat (using your target popup settings)
    * Alt-click a pin to set a waypoint for it
* Add notes on Death Rising rares about their spawn order
* Fix a spawn location for Prince Keleseth

## Changed in v90001.4

* The Death Rising pre-launch rares in Icecrown are added temporarily; they won't actually spawn before the appropriate point in the event is reached
* Improve shift-clicking the popup to add a chat link:
    * New default: immediately send the link to the /general channel
    * Which channel to send to can be configured
    * Old behavior of just opening the default chatbox is available in options
* Map icons no longer require HandyNotes
* Right-clicking the LDB icon on the world map will immediately show the options for the map icons
* Right-clicking the target popup to close it will now happen immediately in combat
* Performance improvements when editing the mob ignore list
* Galleon's chat announcement wasn't being noticed, because Chief Salyis isn't Galleon

## Changed in v90001.3

* Improve shift-clicking the popup to add a chat link:
    * Don't require you to have an open chatbox before pasting it there; open the default chatbox if you have nothing else open
    * Include the health for the mob if we can work it out (if it's a target or its nameplate is visible)
    * For sources that don't include the location (chat yells), link to the player's current location
* Option to hide the target popup when the mob dies
* Option to hide the waypoint arrow when you manually close the popup
* Mobs that you've added to the "custom" section will now bypass most "should I announce this?" checks (e.g. you can ignore the entire Warlords source, and manually-add Rukhmar)
* Unchecking "Got the loot" in the outputs config will now only affect mobs for which we know any drops
* Some _very timely_ improvements on Argus
* Achievement tooltip in the broker tooltip will now show your criteria-completion
* Rukhmar's questid added
* The highlight on the "store" popup theme was covering up the loot icon
* The X on the target popup wasn't appearing when the mob died

* Sha of Anger has only had one spawn point since 7.2 (thanks frumpymoons)

## Changed in v90001.2

* Special map icons for mobs with toys and pets as well
* Broker dropdown added to the mount journal, will show all known mobs that drop mounts (and whether you've looted them)
* Show mob variants in the dropdown, for things like the Mechagon Data Anomalies, Madexx, and the Zandalari Warbringers
* Chat-scanner: looks for mobs in the current zone with that name before checking globally in case of a name-collision
* Chat-scanner: only announce coordinates if it's from a chat event which implies the mob is anywhere near you (yells are zone-wide...)
* Waypoint integration with DeadlyBossMods
* If data on a toy/mount/pet is still loading, say that in the tooltip rather than not showing anything about it at all
* Mists: Nalak and Oondasta questids
* Fixed broken N'zoth and Azerite loot popup target themes
* Included updated version of LibQTip-1.0 which won't error if you have a broken pre-9.0 addon installed with an older version of LibQTip-1.0

## Changed in v90001.1

* Fixed a backdrop error in the "classic" popup target theme

## Changed in v90001.0

* Shadowlands data: most of the new rares are included, with questids and loot. Some are still missing quests, but we've got time.
* Integration with "TomTom" is now "Waypoints", and can use the new built-in waypointing system or TomTom as you choose.
    * Ctrl-clicking the target popup will set a waypoint for the mob.
    * Shift-clicking the target popup will paste a clickable link to the mob to an open chatbox.
    * These waypoints will only be accurate for mobs detected through minimap vignettes, otherwise it's just going to point at wherever you were when you saw it.
    * The built-in waypointing can only have one waypoint at a time, so things like waypointing every spawn of a mob at once aren't possible.
    * If you already have a waypoint, SilverDragon will replace it and then try to restore it. (Or can be configured to not add waypoints if you already have one.)
* Added missing toys in Warlords, Mists, and Legion
* The macro targeting now better respects mobs that should be ignored
* Fixed target scanning to work in instances again
* Fixed chat scanning not opening the target popup
* Fixed an error from chat scanning in instances
* Fixed the id for Rukhmar

## Changed in v80300.5

* Watch for known rares which announce themselves in chat (e.g. Arachnoid Harvester)

* Add right-clicking on the target popup's close button to ignore the mob
* Allow the waypoint auto-clear timer to be set in 5 second increments
* Fix the target popup not showing up after combat ends if you noticed a rare during combat
* Cleaned up some of the warfront map locations
* Stop the achievement completed-by-alt check from behaving differently than whether your current character has completed it

## Changed in v80300.4

* Loot was missing from the Warfront rares
* Warfront rares all had Alliance questids; now they know to check for the Horde ones, too
* New map icon theme: stars

* Fix an error if your target popup theme was set to LessAwesome before v80300.3

## Changed in v80300.3

* Loot
    * Include some data about drops from rares, so you can know whether you've gotten the mount / toy / pet that something drops. Data's present for everything in BFA, and spottily before that
    * You can add this to tooltips for the rare so you'll know when you see it
    * The target popup has a loot icon you can mouse over for details
    * The broker dropdown includes icons breaking out what's dropped and whether you have it already
    * The HandyNotes icons show this in their tooltips

    * Add an option to not announce for mobs that another character has the achievement for, regardless of whether the current character has also completed it

* Background Shadowlands work

## Changed in v80300.2

## Changed in v4.0.17
* Added questids for most Mechagon and Nazjatar rares
* Added some missing Nazjatar rares

## Changed in v4.0.16
* Updated for 8.2
* Added Mechagon and Nazjatar rares (questids to come)
* Added I Thought You Said They'd Be Rare and Rest In Pistons achievements

* Ignored mobs are no longer shown in the broker plugin
* Other missing questids added

## Changed in v4.0.15
* Config wasn't opening because localization for some zone names was broken

* New feature: automatic hiding of the popup after you've not interacted with it for a while (default: 30 seconds)

* Fix automatic-localization of rare names via tooltip-scanning

* Mysterious Camel Figurine now included (see above)
* Record NPC ids from target/mouseover instead of relying purely on the import

## Changed in v2.4.3
* Astrolabe error for people with an updated version of Handynotes is fixed
* Quite a few new cataclysm rares included in the data; reimport to pick them up
* Disabling the rare popup wasn't working
* Some people reported an error when the screen flashed to alert them of a rare. This should plausibly be fixed... though I could never actually reproduce it myself, so no promises yet.

## Changed in v2.4.1
* Fix problem with cache-scanning not always working
* Reran dataminer to pick up information on tamable mobs, which had gone missing

## Changed in v2.4
* TOC to 40000
* Option to skip scanning while on a taxi
* Config rearranged
* Dataminer run once more

## Changed in v2.3.4
* New "clear all rares" option in config.
* HandyNotes updates in response to import/clear without needing a reloadui.
* Actually includes the non-vern dataminer run.

## Changed in v2.3.3
* Update for 30300
* Run dataminer. Forcibly exclude Vern from the dump. So if you clear your seen-rares and then do a new import, you won't see the popup for Vern in Dalaran any more.

## Changed in v2.3.2
* Better handling of player location in instances
* Add zhTW rares translation submitted by s8095324.
* Fix Nameplate/Cache scanning
* Run dataminer

## Changed in v2.3.1
* Missing AceLocale-3.0 embed.
* Cartographer integration bug.

## Changed in v2.3.0
* Default rare list localized to: deDE, frFR, ruRU, esES. Run an import to pick 'em up.
* Better filtering-out of player pets.
* Bump the TOC for SilverDragon_Data, so you don't need to enable out of date addons to import rares any more.

## Changed in v2.2.3
* Different layouts for portrait and full-body model views. Full-body is big and on top of the frame.
* Bump TOC
* AceConsole-3.0 embed was missing. Oops.

## Changed in v2.2.2
* Adjust said targeting frame a bit.
* Fix a bunch of errors I found when looking at the Scarshield Quartermaster.
* More feedback when creating a macro.

## Changed in v2.2.1
* Show in the tooltip whether a mob is already in the unit cache.
* Option to choose what ways of seeing a rare will make the targeting frame appear.
* Bugfix for the click-to-target options not showing. (Thanks to EthanCentaurai!)

## Changed in v2.2.0
* Add click-to-target frame that pops up when a rare is seen.
* Add macro-generator.
* Configure which sound is played when a rare is found. (Thanks to EthanCentaurai!)
* Options for which scanning methods to use.

## Changed in v2.1.2
* Quick fix for a nil error

## Changed in v2.1.1
* Add cache-scanning, much credit to NPCScan by Saiket.
* More options for notifying you: text, sound, screen-flashing.
* LDB tooltip now says whether the rare is tameable.
* For the cache-scanning to work, you have to import data. It relies on NPC ids that can't be gained from within the game.
